This is a remake of the map mp_rundown from modern warfare 2. We tried to keep the map as mod friendly as possible and the map was also tested on a linux dedicated server, it worked, if it does not work on your linux box then I am afraid there is little that can be done to fix it as we optimised everything to the limit. 

Set in a Brazilian village, the maps is divided by a small river. Sadly, the local townsfolk, out of fear of the bird flu epidemic have rid their village of their potential threat. They hastily gathered all of their feathered friends and set them a blaze just down the river from the main village. It was an amazing spectacle of flames, fury and fowl. The feathery abomination was visible for miles and lasted three days....you missed it. So before you ask "where are the chickens"...they're dead...get over it!
